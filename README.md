# Block Blast 64

This is a for-fun project made by Rubyboat to learn how to develop games for the Nintendo 64. This project uses libdragon, so to build just follow the normal build instructions for libdragon games on linux, I'm pretty sure that this build only works on linux, I use wsl2 and it works just fine. It has been tested on the ares emulator and on real console using an EverDrive64 X5. If you have any issues, feel free to write an issue or make a pull request.

If you want to use this project as reference or just look through it, the project is licensed under GPL 3. This means it will be open source and free forever.
